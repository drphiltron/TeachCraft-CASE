In pursuit of ensuring every student in Tennessee achieves this level of success, we begin with rigorous course standards which feed into intentionally designed programs of study. Students engage in industry relevant content through general education integration and experiences such as career and technical student organizations (CTSO) and work-based learning (WBL). Through these experiences, students are immersed with industry standard content and technology, solve industry-based problems, meaningfully interact with industry professionals and use/produce industry specific, informational texts. Using a Career and Technical Student Organization (CTSO) in Your Classroom CTSOs are a great resource to put classroom learning into real-life experiences for your students through classroom, regional, state, and national competitions, and leadership opportunities. Below are CTSO connections for this course, note this is not an exhaustive list. \u2022 Participate in the CTSO Fall Leadership Conference, DECA and FCCLA Fall Leadership Camps, FCCLA District STAR Events, SkillsUSA State Leadership and Skills Conference, and the DECA Emerging Leader Summit to engage with peers, demonstrate logical thought processes, and develop industry specific skills that involve teamwork and project management. \u2022 Participate in conferences that promote career development such as DECA Career Pathways and Career Development Conferences. \u2022 Participate in FCCLA and SkillsUSA career competitive events that highlight career development, including career investigation, interviewing, job skills demonstrations, career pathways showcases, and employment application process (ADA). \u2022 Participate in DECA competitive events such as Food Marketing, Quick Serve Restaurant Management Series, Restaurant and Food Service Management, and Virtual Business Challenge \u2013 Restaurant. \u2022 Participate in FCCLA and SkillsUSA competitive events such as Applied Math for Culinary Management, Baking and Pastry, Culinary Arts, Food Innovations, Nutrition and Wellness, Commercial Baking, and Culinary Arts.
